# software-doc
Samples of software documentation (manuals, posters, etc.) written by the developer of the software (me).

I created this repository to hold samples of software documentation I wrote for projects I developed while working for a previous employer.

Included are user manuals, a symposium poster, and a demo video.

These files are intended both to describe the purpose and functionality of software that I have written professionally, and to demonstrate my ability to document and explain my software to a range of technical and non-technical users.
